# SharedFunctions
This is general-purpose MATLAB functions. They are generally for reading from excel documents or plotting. 

Coding practices are outlined in SharedFunctionsStyleGuide.txt, which was derived mainly from 
	matlab_style_guidelines.pdf from http://www.datatool.com/prod02.htm 
via matlabcentral 
	http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/2529-matlab-programming-style-guidelines

I generally follow the highlighted points, with a few modifications to streamline with Joran's coding style and a few of my personal preferences. The strict rules are followed "strictly" as "rules" while the loose rules are guidelines. I apologize for inconsistencies. Please fix those when found in the source code.
